  # This request lists all zones in a region. Zones represent logically-isolated data centers with high-bandwidth and low-latency interconnects to other zones in the same region. Faults in a zone do not affect other zones.

  # unit tests for list_regions
  # List all regions
  # This request lists all regions. Each region is a separate geographic area that contains multiple isolated zones. Resources can be provisioned into a one or more zones in a region. Each zone is isolated, but connected to other zones in the same region with low-latency and high-bandwidth links. Regions represent the top-level of fault isolation available. Resources deployed within a single region also benefit from the low latency afforded by geographic proximity.
  # @param version Requests the version of the API as of a date in the format &#x60;YYYY-MM-DD&#x60;. Any date up to the current date may be provided. Specify the current date to request the latest version.
