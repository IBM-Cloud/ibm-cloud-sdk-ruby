  # unit tests for create_public_gateway
  # Create a public gateway
  # This request creates a new public gateway from a public gateway prototype object. For this to succeed, the VPC must not already have a public gateway in the specified zone.  If a floating IP is provided, it must be unbound. If a floating IP is not provided, one will be created and bound to the public gateway. Once a public gateway has been created, its floating IP cannot be unbound. A public gateway must be explicitly attached to each subnet it will provide connectivity for.
  # @param version Requests the version of the API as of a date in the format &#x60;YYYY-MM-DD&#x60;. Any date up to the current date may be provided. Specify the current date to request the latest version.
  # @param generation The infrastructure generation for the request. For the API behavior documented here, use &#x60;2&#x60;.
  # @param public_gateway_prototype The public gateway prototype object
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters

  # unit tests for delete_public_gateway
  # Delete specified public gateway
  # This request deletes a public gateway. This operation cannot be reversed. For this request to succeed, the public gateway must not be attached to any subnets. The public gateway&#39;s floating IP will be automatically unbound. If the floating IP was created when the public gateway was created, it will be deleted.
  # @param version Requests the version of the API as of a date in the format &#x60;YYYY-MM-DD&#x60;. Any date up to the current date may be provided. Specify the current date to request the latest version.

  # unit tests for list_public_gateways
  # List all public gateways
  # This request lists all public gateways. A public gateway is a virtual network device associated with a VPC, which allows access to the Internet. A public gateway resides in a zone and can be connected to subnets in the same zone only.

  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [String] :start A server-supplied token determining what resource to start the page on
  # @option opts [Integer] :limit The number of resources to return on a page
  # @option opts [String] :resource_group_id Filters the collection to resources within one of the resource groups identified in a comma-separated list of resource group identifiers
