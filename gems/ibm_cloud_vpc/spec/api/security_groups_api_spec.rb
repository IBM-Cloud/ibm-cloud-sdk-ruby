  # unit tests for create_security_group
  # Create a security group
  # This request creates a new security group from a security group prototype object. The prototype object is structured in the same way as a retrieved security group, and contains the information necessary to create the new security group. If security group rules are included in the protoype object, those rules will be added to the security group. Each security group is scoped to one VPC. Only network interfaces on instances in that VPC can be added to the security group.

  # unit tests for create_security_group_rule
  # Create a security group rule
  # This request creates a new security group rule from a security group rule prototype object. The prototype object is structured in the same way as a retrieved security group rule and contains the information necessary to create the rule. As part of creating a new rule in a security group, the rule is applied to all the networking interfaces in the security group. Rules specify which IP traffic a security group should allow. Security group rules are stateful, such that reverse traffic in response to allowed traffic is automatically permitted. A rule allowing inbound TCP traffic on port 80 also allows outbound TCP traffic on port 80 without the need for an additional rule.
